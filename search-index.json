It was subsequently migrated to its own repository, ibc-go. The first official release on ibc-go was v1.0.0. v1.0.0 was decided to be used instead of v0.1.0 primarily for the following reasons: Maintaining compatibility with the IBC specification v1 requires stronger support/guarantees. Using the major, minor, and patch numbers allows for easier communication of what breaking changes are included in a release. The IBC module is being used by numerous high value projects which require stability.","s":"Context","u":"/architecture/adr-002-go-module-versioning/","h":"/architecture/adr-002-go-module-versioning/#context","p":1178},{"i":1186,"t":"Go module version must be incremented​ When a Go module is released under v1.0.0, all following releases must follow Go semantic versioning. Thus when the go API is broken, the Go module major version must be incremented. For example, changing the go package version from v2 to v3 bumps the import from github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/v2 to github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/v3. If the Go module version is not incremented then attempting to go get a module @v3.0.0 without the suffix results in: invalid version: module contains a go.mod file, so major version must be compatible: should be v0 or v1, not v3 Version validation was added in Go 1.13. This means that in order to release a v3.0.0 git tag without a /v3 suffix on the module definition, the tag must explicitly not contain a go.mod file. Not including a go.mod in our release is not a viable option. Attempting to import multiple go module versions for ibc-go​ Attempting to import two versions of ibc-go, such as github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/v2 and github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/v3, will result in multiple issues. The Cosmos SDK does global registration of error and governance proposal types. The errors and proposals used in ibc-go would need to now register their naming based on the go module version. The more concerning problem is that protobuf definitions will also reach a namespace collision. ibc-go and the Cosmos SDK in general rely heavily on using extended functions for go structs generated from protobuf definitions. This requires the go structs to be defined in the same package as the extended functions. Thus, bumping the import versioning causes the protobuf definitions to be generated in two places (in v2 and v3). When registering these types at compile time, the go compiler will panic. The generated types need to be registered against the proto codec, but there exist two definitions for the same name. The protobuf conflict policy can be overridden via the environment variable GOLANG_PROTOBUF_REGISTRATION_CONFLICT, but it is possible this could lead to various runtime errors or unexpected behaviour (see here). More information here on namespace conflicts for protobuf versioning.","s":"Problems","u":"/architecture/adr-002-go-module-versioning/","h":"/architecture/adr-002-go-module-versioning/#problems","p":1178},{"i":1188,"t":"Changing the protobuf definition version​ The protobuf definitions all have a type URL containing the protobuf version for this type. Changing the protobuf version would solve the namespace collision which arise from importing multiple versions of ibc-go, but it leads to new issues. In the Cosmos SDK, Anys are unpacked and decoded using the type URL. Changing the type URL thus is creating a distinctly different type. The same registration on the proto codec cannot be used to unpack the new type. For example: All Cosmos SDK messages are packed into Anys. If we incremented the protobuf version for our IBC messages, clients which submitted the v1 of our Cosmos SDK messages would now be rejected since the old type is not registered on the codec. The clients must know to submit the v2 of these messages. This pushes the burden of versioning onto relayers and wallets. A more serious problem is that the ClientState and ConsensusState are packed as Anys. Changing the protobuf versioning of these types would break compatibility with IBC specification v1. Moving protobuf definitions to their own go module​ The protobuf definitions could be moved to their own go module which uses 0.x versioning and will never go to 1.0. This prevents the Go module version from being incremented with breaking changes. It also requires all extended functions to live in the same Go module, disrupting the existing code structure. The version that implements this change will still be incompatible with previous versions, but future versions could be imported together without namespace collisions.

The MsgData.MsgType contains the sdk.MsgTypeURL of the sdk.Msg being executed. The MsgData.Data contains the proto marshaled MsgResponse for the associated message executed.

In v0.45 of the SDK, the *sdk.Result.Data will contain the MsgResponse marshaled data. However, the MsgResponse is not packed and marshaled as a *codectypes.Any, thus making it impossible from a generalized point of view to unmarshal the bytes.

This includes such details as: The SignedHeader containing the commitment root. The ValidatorSet that signed the Header. The TrustedHeight seen by the client at less than or equal to the height of Header. The last TrustedValidatorSet at the trusted height. Following the refactor of the 02-client submodule and associated ClientState interfaces, it will now be possible for light client implementations to perform such actions as batch updates, inserting N number of ConsensusStates into the application state tree with a single UpdateClient message. This flexibility is provided in ibc-go by the usage of the Protobuf Any field contained within the UpdateClient message. For example, a batched client update message serialized as a Protobuf Any type for the 07-tendermint lightclient implementation could be defined as follows: message BatchedHeaders { repeated Header headers = 1; } To complement this flexibility, the UpdateClient handler will now support the submission of client misbehaviour by consolidating the Header and Misbehaviour interfaces into a single ClientMessage interface type: // ClientMessage is an interface used to update an IBC client. // The update may be done by a single header, a batch of headers, misbehaviour, or any type which when verified produces // a change to state of the IBC client type ClientMessage interface { proto.Message ClientType() string ValidateBasic() error } To support this functionality the GetHeight() method has been omitted from the new ClientMessage interface.

The Packet relay sending works based in 2 cases (per specification and Colin Axnér's description): Sender chain is acting as the source zone. The coins are transferred to an escrow address (i.e locked) on the sender chain and then transferred to the receiving chain through IBC TAO logic. It is expected that the receiving chain will mint vouchers to the receiving address. Sender chain is acting as the sink zone. The coins (vouchers) are burned on the sender chain and then transferred to the receiving chain through IBC TAO logic. It is expected that the receiving chain, which had previously sent the original denomination, will unescrow the fungible token and send it to the receiving address. Another way of thinking of source and sink zones is through the token's timeline. Each send to any chain other than the one it was previously received from is a movement forwards in the token's timeline. This causes trace to be added to the token's history and the destination port and destination channel to be prefixed to the denomination. In these instances the sender chain is acting as the source zone. When the token is sent back to the chain it previously received from, the prefix is removed. This is a backwards movement in the token's timeline and the sender chain is acting as the sink zone.","s":"Context","u":"/architecture/adr-001-coin-source-tracing/","h":"/architecture/adr-001-coin-source-tracing/#context","p":1293},{"i":1301,"t":"Assume the following channel connections exist and that all channels use the port ID transfer: chain A has channels with chain B and chain C with the IDs channelToB and channelToC, respectively chain B has channels with chain A and chain C with the IDs channelToA and channelToC, respectively chain C has channels with chain A and chain B with the IDs channelToA and channelToB, respectively These steps of transfer between chains occur in the following order: A -> B -> C -> A -> C. In particular: A -> B: sender chain is source zone. A sends packet with denom (escrowed on A), B receives denom and mints and sends voucher transfer/channelToA/denom to recipient. B -> C: sender chain is source zone. B sends packet with transfer/channelToA/denom (escrowed on B), C receives transfer/channelToA/denom and mints and sends voucher transfer/channelToB/transfer/channelToA/denom to recipient. C -> A: sender chain is source zone. C sends packet with transfer/channelToB/transfer/channelToA/denom (escrowed on C), A receives transfer/channelToB/transfer/channelToA/denom and mints and sends voucher transfer/channelToC/transfer/channelToB/transfer/channelToA/denom to recipient.

The token has a final denomination on chain C of transfer/channelToB/transfer/channelToA/denom, where transfer/channelToB/transfer/channelToA is the trace information. In this context, upon a receive of a cross-chain fungible token transfer, if the sender chain is the source of the token, the protocol prefixes the denomination with the port and channel identifiers in the following format: prefix + denom = {destPortN}/{destChannelN}/.../{destPort0}/{destChannel0}/denom Example: transferring 100 uatom from port HubPort and channel HubChannel on the Hub to Ethermint's port EthermintPort and channel EthermintChannel results in 100 EthermintPort/EthermintChannel/uatom, where EthermintPort/EthermintChannel/uatom is the new denomination on the receiving chain.

This poses a problem because, while port and channel identifiers have a maximum length of 64 each, the SDK Coin type only accepts denoms up to 64 characters. Thus, a single cross-chain token, which again, is composed by the port and channels identifiers plus the base denomination, can exceed the length validation for the SDK Coins. This can result in undesired behaviours such as tokens not being able to be transferred to multiple sink chains if the denomination exceeds the length or unexpected panics due to denomination validation failing on the receiving chain. The existence of special characters and uppercase letters on the denomination: In the SDK every time a Coin is initialized through the constructor function NewCoin, a validation of a coin's denom is performed according to a Regex, where only lowercase alphanumeric characters are accepted. While this is desirable for native denominations to keep a clean UX, it presents a challenge for IBC as ports and channels might be randomly generated with special and uppercase characters as per the ICS 024 - Host Requirements specification.","s":"Problem","u":"/architecture/adr-001-coin-source-tracing/","h":"/architecture/adr-001-coin-source-tracing/#problem","p":1293},{"i":1305,"t":"The issues outlined above, are applicable only to SDK-based chains, and thus the proposed solution are do not require specification changes that would result in modification to other implementations of the ICS20 spec.

Currently there exists two different approaches to callbacks being invoked by core IBC. IBC light clients currently are invoked by a ClientState and ConsensusState interface as defined by core IBC. The 02-client submodule will retrieve the ClientState or ConsensusState from the IBC store in order to perform callbacks to the light client. This design requires all required information for the light client to function to be stored in the ClientState or ConsensusState or potentially under metadata keys for a specific client instance. Additional information may be provided by core IBC via the defined interface arguments if that information is generic enough to be useful to all IBC light clients. This constraint has proved problematic as pass through clients (such as wasm) cannot maintain easy access to a VM instance. In addition, without increasing the size of the defined ClientState interface, light clients are unable to take advantage of basic built-in SDK functionality such as genesis import/export and migrations. The other approach used to perform callback logic is via registered SDK modules. This approach is used by core IBC to interact with IBC applications. IBC applications will register their callbacks on the IBC router at compile time. When a packet comes in, core IBC will use the IBC router to lookup the registered callback functions for the provided packet. The benefit of registered callbacks opposed to interface functions is that additional information may be accessed via external keepers. Because the IBC applications are also SDK modules, they additionally get access to a host of functionality provided by the SDK. This includes: genesis import/export, migrations, query/transaction CLI commands, type registration, gRPC query registration, and message server registration.

The tendermint and solo machine clients were refactored to include this AppModuleBasic implementation and core IBC will no longer include either type as registered by default. Longer term solutions include using internal module communication as described in ADR 033 on the SDK. The following functions should become callbacks invoked via intermodule communication: Status GetTimestampAtHeight VerifyMembership VerifyNonMembership Initialize VerifyClientMessage CheckForMisbehaviour UpdateStateOnMisbehaviour UpdateState CheckSubstituteAndUpdateState VerifyUpgradeAndUpdateState The ClientState interface should eventually be trimmed down to something along the lines of: type ClientState interface { proto.Message ClientType() string GetLatestHeight() Height Validate() error ZeroCustomFields() ClientState // ADDITION Route() string // route used for intermodule communication } For the most part, any functions which require access to the client store should likely not be an interface function of the ClientState.

We wish to expand this \"naive\" strategy to a \"passive\" one which detects and relays both channel handshake messages and packets on a given connection, without the need to know each channel in advance of relaying it. In order to accomplish this, we propose adding more comprehensive events to expose channel metadata for each transaction sent from the x/ibc/core/04-channel/keeper/handshake.go and x/ibc/core/04-channel/keeper/packet.go modules. Here is an example of what would be in ChanOpenInit: const ( EventTypeChannelMeta = \"channel_meta\" AttributeKeyAction = \"action\" AttributeKeyHops = \"hops\" AttributeKeyOrder = \"order\" AttributeKeySrcPort = \"src_port\" AttributeKeySrcChannel = \"src_channel\" AttributeKeySrcVersion = \"src_version\" AttributeKeyDstPort = \"dst_port\" AttributeKeyDstChannel = \"dst_channel\" AttributeKeyDstVersion = \"dst_version\" ) // ... // Emit Event with Channel metadata for the relayer to pick up and // relay to the other chain // This appears immediately before the successful return statement. ctx.EventManager().EmitEvents(sdk.Events{ sdk.NewEvent( types.EventTypeChannelMeta, sdk.NewAttribute(types.AttributeKeyAction, \"open_init\"), sdk.NewAttribute(types.AttributeKeySrcConnection, connectionHops[0]), sdk.NewAttribute(types.AttributeKeyHops, strings.Join(connectionHops, \",\")), sdk.NewAttribute(types.AttributeKeyOrder, order.String()), sdk.NewAttribute(types.AttributeKeySrcPort, portID), sdk.NewAttribute(types.AttributeKeySrcChannel, channelID), sdk.NewAttribute(types.AttributeKeySrcVersion, version), sdk.NewAttribute(types.AttributeKeyDstPort, counterparty.GetPortID()), sdk.NewAttribute(types.AttributeKeyDstChannel, counterparty.GetChannelID()), // The destination version is not yet known, but a value is necessary to pad // the event attribute offsets sdk.NewAttribute(types.AttributeKeyDstVersion, \"\"), ), }) These metadata events capture all the \"header\" information needed to route IBC channel handshake transactions without requiring the client to query any data except that of the connection ID that it is willing to relay.

To implement this behavior, we propose replacing the cbs.OnChanOpenTry callback with a new cbs.OnAttemptChanOpenTry callback which explicitly handles the MsgChannelOpenTry, usually by resulting in a call to keeper.ChanOpenTry. The typical implementation, in x/ibc-transfer/module.go would be compatible with the current \"naive\" relayer, as follows: func (am AppModule) OnAttemptChanOpenTry( ctx sdk.Context, chanKeeper channel.Keeper, portCap *capability.Capability, msg channel.MsgChannelOpenTry, ) (*sdk.Result, error) { // Require portID is the portID transfer module is bound to boundPort := am.keeper.GetPort(ctx) if boundPort != msg.PortID { return nil, sdkerrors.Wrapf(porttypes.ErrInvalidPort, \"invalid port: %s, expected %s\", msg.PortID, boundPort) } // BEGIN NEW CODE // Assert our protocol version, overriding the relayer's suggestion. msg.Version = types.Version // Continue the ChanOpenTry. res, chanCap, err := channel.HandleMsgChannelOpenTry(ctx, chanKeeper, portCap, msg) if err != nil { return nil, err } // END OF NEW CODE // ... the rest of the callback is similar to the existing OnChanOpenTry // but uses msg.* directly.

Create a new Msg with two client identifiers (string) and a signer. The first client identifier is the proposed client to be updated. This client must be either frozen or expired. The second client is a substitute client. It carries all the state for the client which may be updated. It must have identical client and chain parameters to the client which may be updated (except for latest height, frozen height, and chain-id). It should be continually updated during the voting period. If this governance proposal passes, the client on trial will be updated to the latest state of the substitute. The signer must be the authority set for the ibc module. Previously, AllowUpdateAfterExpiry and AllowUpdateAfterMisbehaviour were used to signal the recovery options for an expired or frozen client, and governance proposals were not allowed to overwrite the client if these parameters were set to false. However, this has now been deprecated because a code migration can overwrite the client and consensus states regardless of the value of these parameters. If governance would vote to overwrite a client or consensus state, it is likely that governance would also be willing to perform a code migration to do the same. In addition, TrustingPeriod was initially not allowed to be updated by a client upgrade proposal. However, due to the number of situations experienced in production where the TrustingPeriod of a client should be allowed to be updated because of ie: initial misconfiguration for a canonical channel, governance should be allowed to update this client parameter. In versions older than ibc-go v8, MsgRecoverClient was a governance proposal type ClientUpdateProposal. It has been removed and replaced by MsgRecoverClient in the migration from governance v1beta1 to governance v1. Note that this should NOT be lightly updated, as there may be a gap in time between when misbehaviour has occurred and when the evidence of misbehaviour is submitted. For example, if the UnbondingPeriod is 2 weeks and the TrustingPeriod has also been set to two weeks, a validator could wait until right before UnbondingPeriod finishes, submit false information, then unbond and exit without being slashed for misbehaviour. Therefore, we recommend that the trusting period for the 07-tendermint client be set to 2/3 of the UnbondingPeriod. Note that clients frozen due to misbehaviour must wait for the evidence to expire to avoid becoming refrozen.

For atomic multi-message transaction, we want to keep the IBC related state modification to be preserved even the application side state change reverts. One of the example might be IBC token sending message following with stake delegation which uses the tokens received by the previous packet message.

Calling those functions implies that the application logic has successfully executed. However, the handlers can return Result with CodeTxBreak after calling those methods which will persist the state changes that has been already done but prevent any further messages to be executed in case of semantically invalid packet. This will keep the sequence increased in the previous IBC packets(thus preventing double execution) without proceeding to the following messages. In any case the application modules should never return state reverting result, which will make the channel unable to proceed. ChannelKeeper.CheckOpen method will be introduced. This will replace onChanOpen* defined under the routing module specification. Instead of define each channel handshake callback functions, application modules can provide ChannelChecker function with the AppModule which will be injected to ChannelKeeper.Port() at the top level application. CheckOpen will find the correct ChannelChecker using the PortID and call it, which will return an error if it is unacceptable by the application. The ProofVerificationDecorator will be inserted to the top level application. It is not safe to make each module responsible to call proof verification logic, whereas application can misbehave(in terms of IBC protocol) by mistake. The ProofVerificationDecorator should come right after the default sybil attack resistant layer from the current auth.NewAnteHandler: // add IBC ProofVerificationDecorator to the Chain of func NewAnteHandler( ak keeper.AccountKeeper, supplyKeeper types.SupplyKeeper, ibcKeeper ibc.Keeper, sigGasConsumer SignatureVerificationGasConsumer) sdk.AnteHandler { return sdk.ChainAnteDecorators( NewSetUpContextDecorator(), // outermost AnteDecorator. SetUpContext must be called first ... NewIncrementSequenceDecorator(ak), ibcante.ProofVerificationDecorator(ibcKeeper.ClientKeeper, ibcKeeper.ChannelKeeper), // innermost AnteDecorator ) } The implementation of this ADR will also create a Data field of the Packet of type []byte, which can be deserialised by the receiving module into its own private type. It is up to the application modules to do this according to their own interpretation, not by the IBC keeper. This is crucial for dynamic IBC. Example application-side usage: type AppModule struct {} // CheckChannel will be provided to the ChannelKeeper as ChannelKeeper.Port(module.CheckChannel) func (module AppModule) CheckChannel(portID, channelID string, channel Channel) error { if channel.Ordering != UNORDERED { return ErrUncompatibleOrdering() } if channel.CounterpartyPort != \"bank\" { return ErrUncompatiblePort() } if channel.Version != \"\" { return ErrUncompatibleVersion() } return nil } func NewHandler(k Keeper) Handler { return func(ctx Context, msg Msg) Result { switch msg := msg.(type) { case MsgTransfer: return handleMsgTransfer(ctx, k, msg) case ibc.MsgPacket: var data PacketDataTransfer if err := types.ModuleCodec.UnmarshalBinaryBare(msg.GetData(), &data); err != nil { return err } return handlePacketDataTransfer(ctx, k, msg, data) case ibc.MsgTimeoutPacket: var data PacketDataTransfer if err := types.ModuleCodec.UnmarshalBinaryBare(msg.GetData(), &data); err != nil { return err } return handleTimeoutPacketDataTransfer(ctx, k, packet) // interface { PortID() string; ChannelID() string; Channel() ibc.Channel } // MsgChanInit, MsgChanTry implements ibc.MsgChannelOpen case ibc.MsgChannelOpen: return handleMsgChannelOpen(ctx, k, msg) } } } func handleMsgTransfer(ctx Context, k Keeper, msg MsgTransfer) Result { err := k.SendTransfer(ctx,msg.PortID, msg.ChannelID, msg.Amount, msg.Sender, msg.Receiver) if err != nil { return sdk.ResultFromError(err) } return sdk.Result{} } func handlePacketDataTransfer(ctx Context, k Keeper, packet Packet, data PacketDataTransfer) Result { err := k.ReceiveTransfer(ctx, packet.GetSourcePort(), packet.GetSourceChannel(), packet.GetDestinationPort(), packet.GetDestinationChannel(), data) if err != nil { // TODO: Source chain sent invalid packet, shutdown channel } k.ChannelKeeper.WriteAcknowledgement([]byte{0x00}) // WriteAcknowledgement increases the sequence, preventing double spending return sdk.Result{} } func handleCustomTimeoutPacket(ctx Context, k Keeper, packet CustomPacket) Result { err := k.RecoverTransfer(ctx, packet.GetSourcePort(), packet.GetSourceChannel(), packet.GetDestinationPort(), packet.GetDestinationChannel(), data) if err != nil { // This chain sent invalid packet or cannot recover the funds panic(err) } k.ChannelKeeper.DeleteCommitmentTimeout(ctx, packet) // packet timeout should not fail return sdk.Result{} } func handleMsgChannelOpen(sdk.Context, k Keeper, msg MsgOpenChannel) Result { k.AllocateEscrowAddress(ctx, msg.ChannelID()) return sdk.Result{} }","s":"Decision","u":"/architecture/adr-015-ibc-packet-receiver/","h":"/architecture/adr-015-ibc-packet-receiver/#decision","p":1434},{"i":1442,"t":"Proposed","s":"Status","u":"/architecture/adr-015-ibc-packet-receiver/","h":"/architecture/adr-015-ibc-packet-receiver/#status","p":1434},{"i":1445,"t":"Intuitive interface for developers - IBC handlers do not need to care about IBC authentication State change commitment logic is embedded into baseapp.runTx logic","s":"Positive","u":"/architecture/adr-015-ibc-packet-receiver/","h":"/architecture/adr-015-ibc-packet-receiver/#positive","p":1434},{"i":1447,"t":"Cannot support dynamic ports, routing is tied to the baseapp router","s":"Negative","u":"/architecture/adr-015-ibc-packet-receiver/","h":"/architecture/adr-015-ibc-packet-receiver/#negative","p":1434},{"i":1449,"t":"Introduces new AnteHandler decorator.

Adding support for new light clients or updating an existing light client in the event of a security issue or consensus update is a multi-step process which is both time-consuming and error-prone. In order to enable new IBC light client implementations it is necessary to modify the codebase of ibc-go (if the light client is part of its codebase), re-build chains' binaries, pass a governance proposal and validators upgrade their nodes. Another problem stemming from the above process is that if a chain wants to upgrade its own consensus, it will need to convince every chain or hub connected to it to upgrade its light client in order to stay connected. Due to the time-consuming process required to upgrade a light client, a chain with lots of connections needs to be disconnected for quite some time after upgrading its consensus, which can be very expensive in terms of time and effort. We are proposing simplifying this workflow by integrating a Wasm light client module that makes adding support for new light clients a simple governance-gated transaction. The light client bytecode, written in Wasm-compilable Rust, runs inside a Wasm VM. The Wasm light client submodule exposes a proxy light client interface that routes incoming messages to the appropriate handler function, inside the Wasm VM for execution. With the Wasm light client module, anybody can add new IBC light client in the form of Wasm bytecode (provided they are able to submit the governance proposal transaction and that it passes) as well as instantiate clients using any created client type. This allows any chain to update its own light client in other chains without going through the steps outlined above.","s":"Context","u":"/architecture/adr-027-ibc-wasm/","h":"/architecture/adr-027-ibc-wasm/#context","p":1457},{"i":1467,"t":"We decided to implement the Wasm light client module as a light client proxy that will interface with the actual light client uploaded as Wasm bytecode.

To upload a new light client users need to submit a governance v1 proposal that contains the sdk.Msg for storing the Wasm contract's bytecode. The required message is MsgStoreCode and the bytecode is provided in the field wasm_byte_code: // MsgStoreCode defines the request type for the StoreCode rpc. message MsgStoreCode { // signer address string signer = 1; // wasm byte code of light client contract. It can be raw or gzip compressed bytes wasm_byte_code = 2; } The RPC handler processing MsgStoreCode will make sure that the signer of the message matches the address of authority allowed to submit this message (which is normally the address of the governance module). // StoreCode defines a rpc handler method for MsgStoreCode func (k Keeper) StoreCode(goCtx context.Context, msg *types.MsgStoreCode) (*types.MsgStoreCodeResponse, error) { if k.GetAuthority() != msg.Signer { return nil, errorsmod.Wrapf(ibcerrors.ErrUnauthorized, \"expected %s, got %s\", k.GetAuthority(), msg.Signer) } ctx := sdk.UnwrapSDKContext(goCtx) checksum, err := k.storeWasmCode(ctx, msg.WasmByteCode, ibcwasm.GetVM().StoreCode) if err != nil { return nil, errorsmod.Wrap(err, \"failed to store wasm bytecode\") } emitStoreWasmCodeEvent(ctx, checksum) return &types.MsgStoreCodeResponse{ Checksum: checksum, }, nil } The contract's bytecode is not stored in state (it is actually unnecessary and wasteful to store it, since the Wasm VM already stores it and can be queried back, if needed).

This setup worked well for off-chain users interacting with IBC applications. We are now seeing the desire for secondary applications (e.g. smart contracts, modules) to call into IBC apps as part of their state machine logic and then do some actions on the basis of the packet result. Or to receive a packet from IBC and do some logic upon receipt. Example Usecases: Send an ICS-20 packet, and if it is successful, then send an ICA-packet to swap tokens on LP and return funds to sender Execute some logic upon receipt of token transfer to a smart contract address This requires a second layer of callbacks.

The CallbackAddress is the IBC Actor address on which the callback should be called on. The SenderAddress is also provided to optionally allow a VM to ensure that the sender is the same as the callback address. The struct also defines a CommitGasLimit which is the maximum gas a callback is allowed to use. If the callback exceeds this limit, the callback will panic and the tx will commit without the callback's state changes. The ExecutionGasLimit is the practical limit of the tx execution that is set in the context gas meter. It is the minimum of the CommitGasLimit and the gas left in the context gas meter which is determined by the relayer's choice of tx gas limit. If ExecutionGasLimit < CommitGasLimit, then an out-of-gas error will revert the entire transaction without committing anything, allowing for a different relayer to retry with a larger tx gas limit. Any middleware targeting this interface for callback handling should define a global limit that caps the gas that a callback is allowed to take (especially on AcknowledgePacket and TimeoutPacket) so that a custom callback does not prevent the packet lifecycle from completing. However, since this is a global cap it is likely to be very large.

The controller submodule is used for account registration and packet sending. It executes only logic required of all controllers of interchain accounts. The type of authentication used to manage the interchain accounts remains unspecified. There may exist many different types of authentication which are desirable for different use cases. Thus the purpose of the authentication module is to wrap the controller submodule with custom authentication logic. In ibc-go, authentication modules can communicate with the controller submodule by passing messages through baseapp's MsgServiceRouter. To implement an authentication module, the IBCModule interface need not be fulfilled; it is only required to fulfill Cosmos SDK's AppModuleBasic interface, just like any regular Cosmos SDK application module. The authentication module must: Authenticate interchain account owners. Track the associated interchain account address for an owner.

Looking for information on ibc-rs? Click here to go to the ibc-rs github repo. The Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC) is an end-to-end, connection-oriented, stateful protocol for reliable, ordered, and authenticated communication between heterogeneous blockchains arranged in an unknown and dynamic topology. IBC is a protocol that allows blockchains to talk to each other. Chains that speak IBC can share any type of data as long as it's encoded in bytes, enabling the industry’s most feature-rich cross-chain interactions. IBC is secure and permissionless. The protocol realizes this interoperability by specifying a set of data structures, abstractions, and semantics that can be implemented by any distributed ledger that satisfies a small set of requirements. IBC can be used to build a wide range of cross-chain applications that include token transfers, atomic swaps, multi-chain smart contracts (with or without mutually comprehensible VMs), cross-chain account control, and data and code sharding of various kinds.","s":"IBC-Go Documentation","u":"/v8/","h":"","p":1674},{"i":1677,"t":"The following diagram shows how IBC works at a high level: The transport layer (TAO) provides the necessary infrastructure to establish secure connections and authenticate data packets between chains. The application layer builds on top of the transport layer and defines exactly how data packets should be packaged and interpreted by the sending and receiving chains. IBC provides a reliable, permissionless, and generic base layer (allowing for the secure relaying of data packets), while allowing for composability and modularity with separation of concerns by moving application designs (interpreting and acting upon the packet data) to a higher-level layer. This separation is reflected in the categories: IBC/TAO comprises the Transport, Authentication, and Ordering of packets, i.e. the infrastructure layer. IBC/APP consists of the application handlers for the data packets being passed over the transport layer. These include but are not limited to fungible token transfers (ICS-20), NFT transfers (ICS-721), and interchain accounts (ICS-27). Application module: groups any application, middleware or smart contract that may wrap downstream application handlers to provide enhanced functionality. Note three crucial elements in the diagram: The chains depend on relayers to communicate. Relayers are the \"physical\" connection layer of IBC: off-chain processes responsible for relaying data between two chains running the IBC protocol by scanning the state of each chain, constructing appropriate datagrams, and executing them on the opposite chain as is allowed by the protocol. Many relayers can serve one or more channels to send messages between the chains. Each side of the connection uses the light client of the other chain to quickly verify incoming messages.","s":"High-level overview of IBC","u":"/v8/","h":"/v8/#high-level-overview-of-ibc","p":1674},{"i":1679,"t":"The Interchain Accounts module uses either ORDERED or UNORDERED channels. When using ORDERED channels, the order of transactions when sending packets from a controller to a host chain is maintained. When using UNORDERED channels, there is no guarantee that the order of transactions when sending packets from the controller to the host chain is maintained. Since ibc-go v8.3.0, the default ordering for new ICA channels is UNORDERED, if no ordering is specified in MsgRegisterInterchainAccount (previously the default ordering was ORDERED). A limitation when using ORDERED channels is that when a packet times out the channel will be closed. In the case of a channel closing, a controller chain needs to be able to regain access to the interchain account registered on this channel. Active Channels enable this functionality. When an Interchain Account is registered using MsgRegisterInterchainAccount, a new channel is created on a particular port. During the OnChanOpenAck and OnChanOpenConfirm steps (on controller & host chain respectively) the Active Channel for this interchain account is stored in state. It is possible to create a new channel using the same controller chain portID if the previously set Active Channel is now in a CLOSED state. This channel creation can be initialized programmatically by sending a new MsgChannelOpenInit message like so: msg := channeltypes.NewMsgChannelOpenInit(portID, string(versionBytes), channeltypes.ORDERED, []string{connectionID}, icatypes.HostPortID, authtypes.NewModuleAddress(icatypes.ModuleName).String()) handler := keeper.msgRouter.Handler(msg) res, err := handler(ctx, msg) if err != nil { return err } Alternatively, any relayer operator may initiate a new channel handshake for this interchain account once the previously set Active Channel is in a CLOSED state. This is done by initiating the channel handshake on the controller chain using the same portID associated with the interchain account in question. It is important to note that once a channel has been opened for a given interchain account, new channels can not be opened for this account until the currently set Active Channel is set to CLOSED.","s":"Understanding Active Channels","u":"/v8/apps/interchain-accounts/active-channels/","h":"","p":1678},{"i":1681,"t":"Future versions of the ICS-27 protocol and the Interchain Accounts module will likely use a new channel type that provides ordering of packets without the channel closing in the event of a packet timing out, thus removing the need for Active Channels entirely.

Synopsis Authentication modules play the role of the Base Application as described in ICS-30 IBC Middleware, and enable application developers to perform custom logic when working with the Interchain Accounts controller API. The controller submodule is used for account registration and packet sending. It executes only logic required of all controllers of interchain accounts. The type of authentication used to manage the interchain accounts remains unspecified. There may exist many different types of authentication which are desirable for different use cases. Thus the purpose of the authentication module is to wrap the controller submodule with custom authentication logic. In ibc-go, authentication modules are connected to the controller chain via a middleware stack. The controller submodule is implemented as middleware and the authentication module is connected to the controller submodule as the base application of the middleware stack. To implement an authentication module, the IBCModule interface must be fulfilled. By implementing the controller submodule as middleware, any amount of authentication modules can be created and connected to the controller submodule without writing redundant code. The authentication module must: Authenticate interchain account owners. Track the associated interchain account address for an owner. Send packets on behalf of an owner (after authentication). Please note that since ibc-go v6 the channel capability is claimed by the controller submodule and therefore it is not required for authentication modules to claim the capability in the OnChanOpenInit callback. When the authentication module sends packets on the channel created for the associated interchain account it can pass a nil capability to the legacy function SendTx of the controller keeper (see section SendTx for more information).","s":"Deprecation Notice","u":"/v8/apps/interchain-accounts/legacy/auth-modules/","h":"/v8/apps/interchain-accounts/legacy/auth-modules/#deprecation-notice","p":1725},{"i":1729,"t":"The following IBCModule callbacks must be implemented with appropriate custom logic: // OnChanOpenInit implements the IBCModule interface func (im IBCModule) OnChanOpenInit( ctx sdk.Context, order channeltypes.Order, connectionHops []string, portID string, channelID string, chanCap *capabilitytypes.Capability, counterparty channeltypes.Counterparty, version string, ) (string, error) { // since ibc-go v6 the authentication module *must not* claim the channel capability on OnChanOpenInit // perform custom logic return version, nil } // OnChanOpenAck implements the IBCModule interface func (im IBCModule) OnChanOpenAck( ctx sdk.Context, portID, channelID string, counterpartyVersion string, ) error { // perform custom logic return nil } // OnChanCloseConfirm implements the IBCModule interface func (im IBCModule) OnChanCloseConfirm( ctx sdk.Context, portID, channelID string, ) error { // perform custom logic return nil } // OnAcknowledgementPacket implements the IBCModule interface func (im IBCModule) OnAcknowledgementPacket( ctx sdk.Context, packet channeltypes.Packet, acknowledgement []byte, relayer sdk.AccAddress, ) error { // perform custom logic return nil } // OnTimeoutPacket implements the IBCModule interface. func (im IBCModule) OnTimeoutPacket( ctx sdk.Context, packet channeltypes.Packet, relayer sdk.AccAddress, ) error { // perform custom logic return nil } The following functions must be defined to fulfill the IBCModule interface, but they will never be called by the controller submodule so they may error or panic.

Interchain Account: An account on a host chain created using the ICS-27 protocol. An interchain account has all the capabilities of a normal account. However, rather than signing transactions with a private key, a controller chain will send IBC packets to the host chain which signals what transactions the interchain account should execute.

It can be either an IBC application module using the legacy API, or a regular Cosmos SDK application module sending messages to the controller submodule's MsgServer (this is the recommended approach from ibc-go v6 if access to packet callbacks is not needed).

The IBC protocol doesn't know the topology of the overall network (i.e connections between chains and identifier names between them). For this reason, in the multiple hops case, a particular chain in the timeline of the individual transfers can't query the chain and client identifiers of the other chains. Take for example the following sequence of transfers A -> B -> C for an IBC token, with a final prefix path (trace info) of transfer/channelChainC/transfer/channelChainB. What the paragraph above means is that even in the case that chain C is directly connected to chain A, querying the port and channel identifiers that chain B uses to connect to chain A (eg: transfer/channelChainA) can be completely different from the one that chain C uses to connect to chain A (eg: transfer/channelToChainA). Thus the proposed solution for clients that the IBC team recommends are the following: Connect to all chains: Connecting to all the chains in the timeline would allow clients to perform the queries outlined in the direct connection section to each relevant chain. By repeatedly following the port and channel denomination trace transfer timeline, clients should always be able to find all the relevant identifiers. This comes at the tradeoff that the client must connect to nodes on each of the chains in order to perform the queries. Relayer as a Service (RaaS): A longer term solution is to use/create a relayer service that could map the denomination trace to the chain path timeline for each token (i.e origin chain -> chain #1 -> ... -> chain #(n-1) -> final chain). These services could provide merkle proofs in order to allow clients to optionally verify the path timeline correctness for themselves by running light clients. If the proofs are not verified, they should be considered as trusted third parties services. Additionally, client would be advised in the future to use RaaS that support the largest number of connections between chains in the ecosystem. Unfortunately, none of the existing public relayers (in Golang and Rust), provide this service to clients. tip The only viable alternative for clients (at the time of writing) to tokens with multiple connection hops, is to connect to all chains directly and perform relevant queries to each of them in the sequence.","s":"Multiple hops","u":"/v8/apps/transfer/overview/","h":"/v8/apps/transfer/overview/#multiple-hops","p":1819},{"i":1835,"t":"In some exceptional cases, a client state associated with a given channel cannot be updated.

Once the proposal passes the client state will be unfrozen and the funds from the associated channels will then be unlocked. This mechanism only applies to clients that allow updates via governance, such as Tendermint clients. In addition to this, it's important to mention that a token must be sent back along the exact route that it took originally in order to return it to its original form on the source chain (eg: the Cosmos Hub for the uatom).

If your application plans to have linear releases then semantic versioning is recommended. If your application plans to release various features in between major releases then it is advised to use the same versioning scheme as IBC. This versioning scheme specifies a version identifier and compatible feature set with that identifier. Valid version selection includes selecting a compatible version identifier with a subset of features supported by your application for that version. The struct is used for this scheme can be found in 03-connection/types. Since the version type is a string, applications have the ability to do simple version verification via string matching or they can use the already implemented versioning system and pass the proto encoded version into each handhshake call as necessary. ICS20 currently implements basic string matching with a single supported version.","s":"Implement IBCModule Interface and callbacks","u":"/v8/ibc/apps/apps/","h":"/v8/ibc/apps/apps/#implement-ibcmodule-interface-and-callbacks","p":1880},{"i":1888,"t":"Currently, ports must be bound on app initialization.

This process is not specified by IBC as it is up to each application module to determine how to implement this agreement. However, for most applications this will happen as a version negotiation during the channel handshake. While more complex version negotiation is possible to implement inside the channel opening handshake, a very simple version negotiation is implemented in the ibc-transfer module. Thus, a module must define its custom packet data structure, along with a well-defined way to encode and decode it to and from []byte. // Custom packet data defined in application module type CustomPacketData struct { // Custom fields ... } EncodePacketData(packetData CustomPacketData) []byte { // encode packetData to bytes } DecodePacketData(encoded []byte) (CustomPacketData) { // decode from bytes to packet data } Then a module must encode its packet data before sending it through IBC. // retrieve the dynamic capability for this channel channelCap := scopedKeeper.GetCapability(ctx, channelCapName) // Sending custom application packet data data := EncodePacketData(customPacketData) packet.Data = data // Send packet to IBC, authenticating with channelCap sequence, err := IBCChannelKeeper.SendPacket( ctx, channelCap, sourcePort, sourceChannel, timeoutHeight, timeoutTimestamp, data, ) A module receiving a packet must decode the PacketData into a structure it expects so that it can act on it. // Receiving custom application packet data (in OnRecvPacket) packetData := DecodePacketData(packet.Data) // handle received custom packet data Packet Flow Handling​ Just as IBC expected modules to implement callbacks for channel handshakes, IBC also expects modules to implement callbacks for handling the packet flow through a channel. Once a module A and module B are connected to each other, relayers can start relaying packets and acknowledgements back and forth on the channel. Briefly, a successful packet flow works as follows: module A sends a packet through the IBC module the packet is received by module B if module B writes an acknowledgement of the packet then module A will process the acknowledgement if the packet is not successfully received before the timeout, then module A processes the packet's timeout. Sending Packets​ Modules do not send packets through callbacks, since the modules initiate the action of sending packets to the IBC module, as opposed to other parts of the packet flow where msgs sent to the IBC module must trigger execution on the port-bound module through the use of callbacks. Thus, to send a packet a module simply needs to call SendPacket on the IBCChannelKeeper. // retrieve the dynamic capability for this channel channelCap := scopedKeeper.GetCapability(ctx, channelCapName) // Sending custom application packet data data := EncodePacketData(customPacketData) // Send packet to IBC, authenticating with channelCap sequence, err := IBCChannelKeeper.SendPacket( ctx, channelCap, sourcePort, sourceChannel, timeoutHeight, timeoutTimestamp, data, ) warning In order to prevent modules from sending packets on channels they do not own, IBC expects modules to pass in the correct channel capability for the packet's source channel. Receiving Packets​ To handle receiving packets, the module must implement the OnRecvPacket callback. This gets invoked by the IBC module after the packet has been proved valid and correctly processed by the IBC keepers. Thus, the OnRecvPacket callback only needs to worry about making the appropriate state changes given the packet data without worrying about whether the packet is valid or not. Modules may return to the IBC handler an acknowledgement which implements the Acknowledgement interface. The IBC handler will then commit this acknowledgement of the packet so that a relayer may relay the acknowledgement back to the sender module. The state changes that occurred during this callback will only be written if: the acknowledgement was successful as indicated by the Success() function of the acknowledgement if the acknowledgement returned is nil indicating that an asynchronous process is occurring NOTE: Applications which process asynchronous acknowledgements must handle reverting state changes when appropriate. Any state changes that occurred during the OnRecvPacket callback will be written for asynchronous acknowledgements.

In the case where a packet is processed at some later point after the packet has been received (asynchronous execution), the acknowledgement will be written once the packet has been processed by the application which may be well after the packet receipt. NOTE: Most blockchain modules will want to use the synchronous execution model in which the module processes and writes the acknowledgement for a packet as soon as it has been received from the IBC module. This acknowledgement can then be relayed back to the original sender chain, which can take action depending on the contents of the acknowledgement. Just as packet data was opaque to IBC, acknowledgements are similarly opaque. Modules must pass and receive acknowledegments with the IBC modules as byte strings. Thus, modules must agree on how to encode/decode acknowledgements. The process of creating an acknowledgement struct along with encoding and decoding it, is very similar to the packet data example above. ICS 04 specifies a recommended format for acknowledgements. This acknowledgement type can be imported from channel types. While modules may choose arbitrary acknowledgement structs, a default acknowledgement types is provided by IBC here: // Acknowledgement is the recommended acknowledgement format to be used by // app-specific protocols. // NOTE: The field numbers 21 and 22 were explicitly chosen to avoid accidental // conflicts with other protobuf message formats used for acknowledgements. // The first byte of any message with this format will be the non-ASCII values // `0xaa` (result) or `0xb2` (error).

The sender module can then process the acknowledgement using the OnAcknowledgementPacket callback. The contents of the acknowledgement is entirely up to the modules on the channel (just like the packet data); however, it may often contain information on whether the packet was successfully processed along with some additional data that could be useful for remediation if the packet processing failed. Since the modules are responsible for agreeing on an encoding/decoding standard for packet data and acknowledgements, IBC will pass in the acknowledgements as []byte to this callback. The callback is responsible for decoding the acknowledgement and processing it. OnAcknowledgementPacket( ctx sdk.Context, packet channeltypes.Packet, acknowledgement []byte, ) (*sdk.Result, error) { // Decode acknowledgement ack := DecodeAcknowledgement(acknowledgement) // process ack res, err := processAck(ack) return res, err } Timeout Packets​ If the timeout for a packet is reached before the packet is successfully received or the counterparty channel end is closed before the packet is successfully received, then the receiving chain can no longer process it. Thus, the sending chain must process the timeout using OnTimeoutPacket to handle this situation. Again the IBC module will verify that the timeout is indeed valid, so our module only needs to implement the state machine logic for what to do once a timeout is reached and the packet can no longer be received.

This document outlines the channel upgrade feature, and the multiple steps used in the upgrade process.","s":"Channel Upgrades","u":"/v8/ibc/channel-upgrades/","h":"","p":1967},{"i":1970,"t":"Channel upgrades will be achieved using a handshake process that is designed to be similar to the standard connection/channel opening handshake. type Channel struct { // current state of the channel end State State `protobuf:\"varint,1,opt,name=state,proto3,enum=ibc.core.channel.v1.State\" json:\"state,omitempty\"` // whether the channel is ordered or unordered Ordering Order `protobuf:\"varint,2,opt,name=ordering,proto3,enum=ibc.core.channel.v1.Order\" json:\"ordering,omitempty\"` // counterparty channel end Counterparty Counterparty `protobuf:\"bytes,3,opt,name=counterparty,proto3\" json:\"counterparty\"` // list of connection identifiers, in order, along which packets sent on // this channel will travel ConnectionHops []string `protobuf:\"bytes,4,rep,name=connection_hops,json=connectionHops,proto3\" json:\"connection_hops,omitempty\"` // opaque channel version, which is agreed upon during the handshake Version string `protobuf:\"bytes,5,opt,name=version,proto3\" json:\"version,omitempty\"` // upgrade sequence indicates the latest upgrade attempt performed by this channel // the value of 0 indicates the channel has never been upgraded UpgradeSequence uint64 `protobuf:\"varint,6,opt,name=upgrade_sequence,json=upgradeSequence,proto3\" json:\"upgrade_sequence,omitempty\"` } The version, connection hops, and channel ordering are fields in this channel struct which can be changed. For example, the fee middleware can be added to an application module by updating the version string shown here. However, although connection hops can change in a channel upgrade, both sides must still be each other's counterparty. This is enforced by the upgrade protocol and upgrade attempts which try to alter an expected counterparty will fail. On a high level, successful handshake process for channel upgrades works as follows: The chain initiating the upgrade process will propose an upgrade. If the counterparty agrees with the proposal, it will block sends and begin flushing any in-flight packets on its channel end. This flushing process will be covered in more detail below. Upon successful completion of the previous step, the initiating chain will also block packet sends and begin flushing any in-flight packets on its channel end. Once both channel ends have completed flushing packets within the upgrade timeout window, both channel ends can be opened and upgraded to the new channel fields. Each handshake step will be documented below in greater detail.","s":"Channel Upgrade Handshake","u":"/v8/ibc/channel-upgrades/","h":"/v8/ibc/channel-upgrades/#channel-upgrade-handshake","p":1967},{"i":1972,"t":"A channel upgrade is initialised by submitting the MsgChannelUpgradeInit message, which can be submitted only by the chain itself upon governance authorization.

This will set the timeout on the upgrade and update the channel state to FLUSHING which will block the upgrade from continuing until all in-flight packets have been flushed. This will also set the upgrade timeout for the counterparty (i.e. the timeout before which the counterparty chain must move from FLUSHING to FLUSHCOMPLETE; if it doesn't then the chain will cancel the upgrade and write an error receipt). The timeout is a relative time duration in nanoseconds that can be changed with MsgUpdateParams and by default is 10 minutes. The state will change to FLUSHCOMPLETE once there are no in-flight packets left and the channel end is ready to move to OPEN. This flush state will also have an impact on how a channel upgrade can be cancelled, as detailed below. All other parameters will remain the same during the upgrade handshake until the upgrade handshake completes. When the channel is reset to OPEN on a successful upgrade handshake, the relevant fields on the channel end will be switched over to the UpgradeFields specified in the upgrade. note When transitioning a channel from UNORDERED to ORDERED, new packet sends from the channel end which upgrades first will be incapable of being timed out until the counterparty has finished upgrading. warning Due to the addition of new channel states, packets can still be received and processed in both FLUSHING and FLUSHCOMPLETE states. Packets can also be acknowledged in the FLUSHING state. Acknowledging will not be possible when the channel is in the FLUSHCOMPLETE state, since all packets sent from that channel end have been flushed. Application developers should consider these new states when implementing application logic that relies on the channel state. It is still only possible to send packets when the channel is in the OPEN state, but sending is disallowed when the channel enters FLUSHING and FLUSHCOMPLETE.

If upgrades cannot be performed in a timely manner (due to unforeseen flushing issues), upgrade timeouts allow the channel to avoid blocking packet sends indefinitely. If flushing exceeds the time limit set in the UpgradeTimeout channel Params, the upgrade process will need to be timed out to abort the upgrade attempt and resume normal channel processing.

Specifically with regard to IBC, core IBC maintains its own IAVL store, and IBC apps (e.g. transfer) maintain their own dedicated stores. The Cosmos SDK multistore therefore creates a simple merkle tree of all of these IAVL trees, and from each of these individual IAVL tree root hashes it derives a root hash for the application state tree as a whole (the AppHash).

IBC clients track the consensus states of other blockchains, along with the proof spec necessary to properly verify proofs against the client's consensus state. A client can be associated with any number of connections to the counterparty chain. The client identifier is auto generated using the client type and the global client counter appended in the format: {client-type}-{N}. A ClientState should contain chain specific and light client specific information necessary for verifying updates and upgrades to the IBC client. The ClientState may contain information such as chain-id, latest height, proof specs, unbonding periods or the status of the light client. The ClientState should not contain information that is specific to a given block at a certain height, this is the function of the ConsensusState. Each ConsensusState should be associated with a unique block and should be referenced using a height. IBC clients are given a client identifier prefixed store to store their associated client state and consensus states along with any metadata associated with the consensus states. Consensus states are stored using their associated height. The supported IBC clients are: Solo Machine light client: Devices such as phones, browsers, or laptops.

A revision typically represents a continuous, monotonically increasing range of block-heights. The RevisionHeight represents the height of the chain within the given revision. On any reset of the RevisionHeight—for example, when hard-forking a Tendermint chain— the RevisionNumber will get incremented. This allows IBC clients to distinguish between a block-height n of a previous revision of the chain (at revision p) and block-height n of the current revision of the chain (at revision e). Heights that share the same revision number can be compared by simply comparing their respective RevisionHeights. Heights that do not share the same revision number will only be compared using their respective RevisionNumbers. Thus a height h with revision number e+1 will always be greater than a height g with revision number e, REGARDLESS of the difference in revision heights. Ex: Height{RevisionNumber: 3, RevisionHeight: 0} > Height{RevisionNumber: 2, RevisionHeight: 100000000000} When a Tendermint chain is running a particular revision, relayers can simply submit headers and proofs with the revision number given by the chain's chainID, and the revision height given by the Tendermint block height. When a chain updates using a hard-fork and resets its block-height, it is responsible for updating its chainID to increment the revision number. IBC Tendermint clients then verifies the revision number against their chainID and treat the RevisionHeight as the Tendermint block-height. Tendermint chains wishing to use revisions to maintain persistent IBC connections even across height-resetting upgrades must format their chainIDs in the following manner: {chainID}-{revision_number}. On any height-resetting upgrade, the chainID MUST be updated with a higher revision number than the previous value. Ex: Before upgrade chainID: gaiamainnet-3 After upgrade chainID: gaiamainnet-4 Clients that do not require revisions, such as the solo-machine client, simply hardcode 0 into the revision number whenever they need to return an IBC height when implementing IBC interfaces and use the RevisionHeight exclusively. Other client-types can implement their own logic to verify the IBC heights that relayers provide in their Update, Misbehavior, and Verify functions respectively.

The connection handshake is responsible for verifying that the light clients on each chain are correct for their respective counterparties. Connections, once established, are responsible for facilitating all cross-chain verifications of IBC state. A connection can be associated with any number of channels. The connection handshake is a 4-step handshake. Briefly, if a given chain A wants to open a connection with chain B using already established light-clients on both chains: chain A sends a ConnectionOpenInit message to signal a connection initialization attempt with chain B. chain B sends a ConnectionOpenTry message to try opening the connection on chain A. chain A sends a ConnectionOpenAck message to mark its connection end state as open. chain B sends a ConnectionOpenConfirm message to mark its connection end state as open. Time Delayed Connections​ Connections can be opened with a time delay by setting the delayPeriod field (in nanoseconds) in the MsgConnectionOpenInit. The time delay is used to require that the underlying light clients have been updated to a certain height before commitment verification can be performed. delayPeriod is used in conjunction with the max_expected_time_per_block parameter of the connection submodule to determine the blockDelay, which is number of blocks that the connection must be delayed by. When commitment verification is performed, the connection submodule will pass delayPeriod and blockDelay to the light client.

Thus, IBC must authenticate module actions on ports and channels so that only modules with the appropriate permissions can use them. This module authentication is accomplished using a dynamic capability store. Upon binding to a port or creating a channel for a module, IBC returns a dynamic capability that the module must claim in order to use that port or channel. The dynamic capability module prevents other modules from using that port or channel since they do not own the appropriate capability. While this background information is useful, IBC modules do not need to interact at all with these lower-level abstractions. The relevant abstraction layer for IBC application developers is that of channels and ports. IBC applications must be written as self-contained modules. A module on one blockchain can communicate with other modules on other blockchains by sending, receiving, and acknowledging packets through channels that are uniquely identified by the (channelID, portID) tuple. A useful analogy is to consider IBC modules as internet applications on a computer. A channel can then be conceptualized as an IP connection, with the IBC portID being analogous to an IP port and the IBC channelID being analogous to an IP address. Thus, a single instance of an IBC module can communicate on the same port with any number of other modules and IBC correctly routes all packets to the relevant module using the (channelID, portID tuple). An IBC module can also communicate with another IBC module over multiple ports, with each (portID<->portID) packet stream being sent on a different unique channel.","s":"Capabilities","u":"/v8/ibc/overview/","h":"/v8/ibc/overview/#capabilities","p":2213},{"i":2229,"t":"An IBC module can bind to any number of ports.

In order to take action on a particular port (for example, an open channel with its portID), a module must provide the dynamic object capability to the IBC handler. This requirement prevents a malicious module from opening channels with ports it does not own. Thus, IBC modules are responsible for claiming the capability that is returned on BindPort.","s":"Ports","u":"/v8/ibc/overview/","h":"/v8/ibc/overview/#ports","p":2213},{"i":2231,"t":"An IBC channel can be established between two IBC ports. Currently, a port is exclusively owned by a single module. IBC packets are sent over channels. Just as IP packets contain the destination IP address and IP port, and the source IP address and source IP port, IBC packets contain the destination portID and channelID, and the source portID and channelID. This packet structure enables IBC to correctly route packets to the destination module while allowing modules receiving packets to know the sender module. A channel can be ORDERED, where packets from a sending module must be processed by the receiving module in the order they were sent. Or a channel can be UNORDERED, where packets from a sending module are processed in the order they arrive (might be in a different order than they were sent). Modules can choose which channels they wish to communicate over with, thus IBC expects modules to implement callbacks that are called during the channel handshake. These callbacks can do custom channel initialization logic. If any callback returns an error, the channel handshake fails. Thus, by returning errors on callbacks, modules can programmatically reject and accept channels. The channel handshake is a 4-step handshake. Briefly, if a given chain A wants to open a channel with chain B using an already established connection: chain A sends a ChanOpenInit message to signal a channel initialization attempt with chain B. chain B sends a ChanOpenTry message to try opening the channel on chain A. chain A sends a ChanOpenAck message to mark its channel end status as open. chain B sends a ChanOpenConfirm message to mark its channel end status as open. If all handshake steps are successful, the channel is opened on both sides. At each step in the handshake, the module associated with the ChannelEnd executes its callback. So on ChanOpenInit, the module on chain A executes its callback OnChanOpenInit. The channel identifier is auto derived in the format: channel-{N} where N is the next sequence to be used. Just as ports came with dynamic capabilities, channel initialization returns a dynamic capability that the module must claim so that they can pass in a capability to authenticate channel actions like sending packets. The channel capability is passed into the callback on the first parts of the handshake; either OnChanOpenInit on the initializing chain or OnChanOpenTry on the other chain. Closing channels​ Closing a channel occurs in 2 handshake steps as defined in ICS 04. Once a channel is closed, it cannot be reopened. The channel handshake steps are: ChanCloseInit closes a channel on the executing chain if the channel exists and it is not already closed, the connection it exists upon is OPEN, the IBC module callback OnChanCloseInit returns nil. ChanCloseInit can be initiated by any user by submitting a MsgChannelCloseInit transaction. Note that channels are automatically closed when a packet times out on an ORDERED channel. A timeout on an ORDERED channel skips the ChanCloseInit step and immediately closes the channel. ChanCloseConfirm is a response to a counterparty channel executing ChanCloseInit. The channel on the executing chain closes if the channel exists and is not already closed, the connection the channel exists upon is OPEN, the executing chain successfully verifies that the counterparty channel has been closed the IBC module callback OnChanCloseConfirm returns nil. Currently, none of the IBC applications provided in ibc-go support ChanCloseInit.","s":"Channels","u":"/v8/ibc/overview/","h":"/v8/ibc/overview/#channels","p":2213},{"i":2233,"t":"Modules communicate with each other by sending packets over IBC channels. All IBC packets contain the destination portID and channelID along with the source portID and channelID. This packet structure allows modules to know the sender module of a given packet. IBC packets contain a sequence to optionally enforce ordering. IBC packets also contain a TimeoutHeight and a TimeoutTimestamp that determine the deadline before the receiving module must process a packet. Modules send custom application data to each other inside the Data []byte field of the IBC packet. Thus, packet data is opaque to IBC handlers. It is incumbent on a sender module to encode their application-specific packet information into the Data field of packets. The receiver module must decode that Data back to the original application data.","s":"Packets","u":"/v8/ibc/overview/","h":"/v8/ibc/overview/#packets","p":2213},{"i":2235,"t":"Since IBC works over a distributed network and relies on potentially faulty relayers to relay messages between ledgers, IBC must handle the case where a packet does not get sent to its destination in a timely manner or at all. Packets must specify a non-zero value for timeout height (TimeoutHeight) or timeout timestamp (TimeoutTimestamp ) after which a packet can no longer be successfully received on the destination chain. The timeoutHeight indicates a consensus height on the destination chain after which the packet is no longer be processed, and instead counts as having timed-out. The timeoutTimestamp indicates a timestamp on the destination chain after which the packet is no longer be processed, and instead counts as having timed-out. If the timeout passes without the packet being successfully received, the packet can no longer be received on the destination chain. The sending module can timeout the packet and take appropriate actions. If the timeout is reached, then a proof of packet timeout can be submitted to the original chain. The original chain can then perform application-specific logic to timeout the packet, perhaps by rolling back the packet send changes (refunding senders any locked funds, etc.). In ORDERED channels, a timeout of a single packet in the channel causes the channel to close. If packet sequence n times out, then a packet at sequence k > n cannot be received without violating the contract of ORDERED channels that packets are processed in the order that they are sent. Since ORDERED channels enforce this invariant, a proof that sequence n has not been received on the destination chain by the specified timeout of packet n is sufficient to timeout packet n and close the channel. In UNORDERED channels, the application-specific timeout logic for that packet is applied and the channel is not closed. Packets can be received in any order. IBC writes a packet receipt for each sequence receives in the UNORDERED channel. This receipt does not contain information; it is simply a marker intended to signify that the UNORDERED channel has received a packet at the specified sequence. To timeout a packet on an UNORDERED channel, a proof is required that a packet receipt does not exist for the packet's sequence by the specified timeout. For this reason, most modules should use UNORDERED channels as they require fewer liveness guarantees to function effectively for users of that channel.","s":"Receipts and Timeouts","u":"/v8/ibc/overview/","h":"/v8/ibc/overview/#receipts-and-timeouts","p":2213},{"i":2237,"t":"Modules can also choose to write application-specific acknowledgments upon processing a packet. Acknowledgments can be done: Synchronously on OnRecvPacket if the module processes packets as soon as they are received from IBC module. Asynchronously if module processes packets at some later point after receiving the packet. This acknowledgment data is opaque to IBC much like the packet Data and is treated by IBC as a simple byte string []byte. Receiver modules must encode their acknowledgment so that the sender module can decode it correctly. The encoding must be negotiated between the two parties during version negotiation in the channel handshake. The acknowledgment can encode whether the packet processing succeeded or failed, along with additional information that allows the sender module to take appropriate action. After the acknowledgment has been written by the receiving chain, a relayer relays the acknowledgment back to the original sender module. The original sender module then executes application-specific acknowledgment logic using the contents of the acknowledgment. After an acknowledgement fails, packet-send changes can be rolled back (for example, refunding senders in ICS20). After an acknowledgment is received successfully on the original sender on the chain, the corresponding packet commitment is deleted since it is no longer needed.","s":"Acknowledgments","u":"/v8/ibc/overview/","h":"/v8/ibc/overview/#acknowledgments","p":2213},{"i":2239,"t":"If you want to learn more about IBC, check the following specifications: IBC specification overview","s":"Further Readings and Specs","u":"/v8/ibc/overview/","h":"/v8/ibc/overview/#further-readings-and-specs","p":2213},{"i":2241,"t":"Learn how to integrate the 08-wasm module in a chain binary and about the recommended approaches depending on whether the x/wasm module is already used in the chain.

Currently the only option available is the WithQueryPlugins option, which allows registration of custom query plugins for the 08-wasm module. The use of this API is optional and it is only required if the chain wants to register custom query plugins for the 08-wasm module. WithQueryPlugins​ By default, the 08-wasm module does not configure any querier options for light client contracts. However, it is possible to register custom query plugins for QueryRequest::Custom and QueryRequest::Stargate. Assuming that the keeper is not yet instantiated, the following sample code shows how to register query plugins for the 08-wasm module. We first construct a QueryPlugins object with the desired query plugins: queryPlugins := ibcwasmtypes.QueryPlugins { Custom: MyCustomQueryPlugin(), // `myAcceptList` is a `[]string` containing the list of gRPC query paths that the chain wants to allow for the `08-wasm` module to query. // These queries must be registered in the chain's gRPC query router, be deterministic, and track their gas usage. // The `AcceptListStargateQuerier` function will return a query plugin that will only allow queries for the paths in the `myAcceptList`. // The query responses are encoded in protobuf unlike the implementation in `x/wasm`. Stargate: ibcwasmtypes.AcceptListStargateQuerier(myAcceptList), } Note that the Stargate querier appends the user defined accept list of query routes to a default list defined by the 08-wasm module. The defaultAcceptList defines a single query route: \"/ibc.core.client.v1.Query/VerifyMembership\". This allows for light client smart contracts to delegate parts of their workflow to other light clients for auxiliary proof verification. For example, proof of inclusion of block and tx data by a data availability provider. // defaultAcceptList defines a set of default allowed queries made available to the Querier. var defaultAcceptList = []string{ \"/ibc.core.client.v1.Query/VerifyMembership\", } You may leave any of the fields in the QueryPlugins object as nil if you do not want to register a query plugin for that query type. Then, we pass the QueryPlugins object to the WithQueryPlugins option: querierOption := ibcwasmkeeper.WithQueryPlugins(&queryPlugins) Finally, we pass the option to the NewKeeperWithConfig or NewKeeperWithVM constructor function during Keeper instantiation: app.WasmClientKeeper = ibcwasmkeeper.NewKeeperWithConfig( appCodec, runtime.NewKVStoreService(keys[ibcwasmtypes.StoreKey]), app.IBCKeeper.ClientKeeper, authtypes.NewModuleAddress(govtypes.ModuleName).String(), wasmConfig, app.GRPCQueryRouter(), + querierOption, ) app.WasmClientKeeper = ibcwasmkeeper.NewKeeperWithVM( appCodec, runtime.NewKVStoreService(keys[ibcwasmtypes.StoreKey]), app.IBCKeeper.ClientKeeper, authtypes.NewModuleAddress(govtypes.ModuleName).String(), wasmer, // pass the Wasm VM instance to `08-wasm` keeper constructor app.GRPCQueryRouter(), + querierOption, )","s":"Options","u":"/v8/ibc/light-clients/wasm/integration/","h":"/v8/ibc/light-clients/wasm/integration/#options","p":2240},{"i":2255,"t":"If the chain's 02-client submodule parameter AllowedClients contains the single wildcard \"*\" element, then it is not necessary to do anything in order to allow the creation of 08-wasm clients.

However, there are cases where some functionality may be desired by many applications, yet not appropriate to place in core IBC. Middleware allows developers to define the extensions as separate modules that can wrap over the base application. This middleware can thus perform its own custom logic, and pass data into the application so that it may run its logic without being aware of the middleware's existence.

Middleware accomplishes this by formatting the version in a JSON-encoded string containing the middleware version and the application version. The application version may as well be a JSON-encoded string, possibly including further middleware and app versions, if the application stack consists of multiple milddlewares wrapping a base application. The format of the version is specified in ICS-30 as the following: { \"<middleware_version_key>\": \"<middleware_version_value>\", \"app_version\": \"<application_version_value>\" } The <middleware_version_key> key in the JSON struct should be replaced by the actual name of the key for the corresponding middleware (e.g. fee_version). During the handshake callbacks, the middleware can unmarshal the version string and retrieve the middleware and application versions. It can do its negotiation logic on <middleware_version_value>, and pass the <application_version_value> to the underlying application. NOTE: Middleware that does not need to negotiate with a counterparty middleware on the remote stack will not implement the version unmarshalling and negotiation, and will simply perform its own custom logic on the callbacks without relying on the counterparty behaving similarly.

This allows IBC applications to be built on top of core IBC, and to be able to execute custom logic on packet lifecycle events (e.g. unescrow tokens for ICS-20). This setup worked well for off-chain users interacting with IBC applications. However, we are now seeing the desire for secondary applications (e.g. smart contracts, modules) to call into IBC apps as part of their state machine logic and then do some actions on packet lifecycle events. The Callbacks Middleware allows for this functionality by allowing the packets of the underlying IBC applications to register callbacks to secondary applications for lifecycle events. These callbacks are then executed by the Callbacks Middleware when the corresponding packet lifecycle event occurs. After much discussion, the design was expanded to an ADR, and the Callbacks Middleware is an implementation of that ADR.","s":"What is the Callbacks Middleware?","u":"/v8/middleware/callbacks/overview/","h":"/v8/middleware/callbacks/overview/#what-is-the-callbacks-middleware","p":2361},{"i":2366,"t":"Callbacks Middleware was built with smart contracts in mind, but can be used by any secondary application that wants to allow IBC packets to call into it. Think of the Callbacks Middleware as a bridge between core IBC and a secondary application. We have the following definitions: Underlying IBC application: The IBC application that is wrapped by the Callbacks Middleware. This is the IBC application that is actually sending and receiving packet lifecycle events from core IBC. For example, the transfer module, or the ICA controller submodule. IBC Actor: IBC Actor is an on-chain or off-chain entity that can initiate a packet on the underlying IBC application. For example, a smart contract, an off-chain user, or a module that sends a transfer packet are all IBC Actors. Secondary application: The application that is being called into by the Callbacks Middleware for packet lifecycle events. This is the application that is receiving the callback directly from the Callbacks Middleware module. For example, the x/wasm module. Callback Actor: The on-chain smart contract or module that is registered to receive callbacks from the secondary application. For example, a Wasm smart contract (gatekeeped by the x/wasm module). Note that the Callback Actor is not necessarily the same as the IBC Actor. For example, an off-chain user can initiate a packet on the underlying IBC application, but the Callback Actor could be a smart contract. The secondary application may want to check that the IBC Actor is allowed to call into the Callback Actor, for example, by checking that the IBC Actor is the same as the Callback Actor. Callback Address: Address of the Callback Actor. This is the address that the secondary application will call into when a packet lifecycle event occurs. For example, the address of the Wasm smart contract. Maximum gas limit: The maximum amount of gas that the Callbacks Middleware will allow the secondary application to use when it executes its custom logic. User defined gas limit: The amount of gas that the IBC Actor wants to allow the secondary application to use when it executes its custom logic. This is the gas limit that the IBC Actor specifies when it sends a packet to the underlying IBC application. This cannot be greater than the maximum gas limit. Think of the secondary application as a bridge between the Callbacks Middleware and the Callback Actor. The secondary application is responsible for executing the custom logic of the Callback Actor when a packet lifecycle event occurs. The secondary application is also responsible for checking that the IBC Actor is allowed to call into the Callback Actor. Note that it is possible that the IBC Actor, Secondary Application, and Callback Actor are all the same entity.

Therefore, if it is desirable to use a module account that is currently blocked, the module developers should be consulted to gauge to possibility of removing the module account from the blocked list. type MsgRegisterCounterpartyPayee struct { // unique port identifier PortId string // unique channel identifier ChannelId string // the relayer address Relayer string // the counterparty payee address CounterpartyPayee string } This message is expected to fail if: PortId is invalid (see 24-host naming requirements.

However, the relayer infrastructure ensures liveness of the Interchain network — operators listen for packets sent through channels opened between chains, and perform the vital service of ferrying these packets (and proof of the transaction on the sending chain/receipt on the receiving chain) to the clients on each side of the channel. Though relaying is permissionless and completely decentralized and accessible, it does come with operational costs. Running full nodes to query transaction proofs and paying for transaction fees associated with IBC packets are two of the primary cost burdens which have driven the overall discussion on a general, in-protocol incentivization mechanism for relayers. Initially, a simple proposal was created to incentivize relaying on ICS20 token transfers on the destination chain. However, the proposal was specific to ICS20 token transfers and would have to be reimplemented in this format on every other IBC application module. After much discussion, the proposal was expanded to a general incentivisation design that can be adopted by any ICS application protocol as middleware.","s":"What is the Fee Middleware module?","u":"/v8/middleware/ics29-fee/overview/","h":"/v8/middleware/ics29-fee/overview/#what-is-the-fee-middleware-module","p":2435},{"i":2440,"t":"ICS29 fee payments in this middleware design are built on the assumption that sender chains are the source of incentives — the chain on which packets are incentivized is the chain that distributes fees to relayer operators. However, as part of the IBC packet flow, messages have to be submitted on both sender and destination chains. This introduces the requirement of a mapping of relayer operator's addresses on both chains. To achieve the stated requirements, the fee middleware module has two main groups of functionality: Registering of relayer addresses associated with each party involved in relaying the packet on the source chain. This registration process can be automated on start up of relayer infrastructure and happens only once, not every packet flow. This is described in the Fee distribution section. Escrowing fees by any party which will be paid out to each rightful party on completion of the packet lifecycle. This is described in the Fee messages section. We complete the introduction by giving a list of definitions of relevant terminology. Forward relayer: The relayer that submits the MsgRecvPacket message for a given packet (on the destination chain). Reverse relayer: The relayer that submits the MsgAcknowledgement message for a given packet (on the source chain). Timeout relayer: The relayer that submits the MsgTimeout or MsgTimeoutOnClose messages for a given packet (on the source chain). Payee: The account address on the source chain to be paid on completion of the packet lifecycle. The packet lifecycle on the source chain completes with the receipt of a MsgTimeout/MsgTimeoutOnClose or a MsgAcknowledgement. Counterparty payee: The account address to be paid on completion of the packet lifecycle on the destination chain. The package lifecycle on the destination chain completes with a successful MsgRecvPacket. Refund address: The address of the account paying for the incentivization of packet relaying. The account is refunded timeout fees upon successful acknowledgement.

All versions of ibc-go smaller than v1.5.0 for the v1.x release line, v2.3.0 for the v2.x release line, and v3.1.0 for the v3.x release line do NOT support IBC token transfers of coins whose base denoms contain slashes. Therefore the in-place of genesis migration described in this document are required when upgrading. If a chain receives coins of a base denom with slashes before it upgrades to supporting it, the receive may pass however the trace information will be incorrect. E.g. If a base denom of testcoin/testcoin/testcoin is sent to a chain that does not support slashes in the base denom, the receive will be successful. However, the trace information stored on the receiving chain will be: Trace: \"transfer/{channel-id}/testcoin/testcoin\", BaseDenom: \"testcoin\".

If the chain will migrate to supporting base denoms with slashes, it must set the appropriate params during the execution of the upgrade handler in app.go: app.UpgradeKeeper.SetUpgradeHandler(\"MigrateTraces\", func(ctx sdk.Context, _ upgradetypes.Plan, fromVM module.VersionMap) (module.VersionMap, error) { // transfer module consensus version has been bumped to 2 return app.mm.RunMigrations(ctx, app.configurator, fromVM) }) If a chain receives coins of a base denom with slashes before it upgrades to supporting it, the receive may pass however the trace information will be incorrect.

The Base Application was intended to be composed with the ICS27 controller submodule Keeper and facilitate many forms of message authentication depending on a chain's particular use case. Prior to ibc-go v6 the controller submodule exposed only these two functions (to which we will refer as the legacy APIs): RegisterInterchainAccount SendTx However, these functions have now been deprecated in favour of the new controller submodule MsgServer and will be removed in later releases. Both APIs remain functional and maintain backwards compatibility in ibc-go v6, however consumers of these APIs are now recommended to follow the message passing paradigm outlined in Cosmos SDK ADR 031 and ADR 033. This is facilitated by the Cosmos SDK MsgServiceRouter and chain developers creating custom application logic can now omit the ICS27 controller submodule Keeper from their module and instead depend on message routing. Depending on the use case, developers of custom authentication modules face one of three scenarios: My authentication module needs to access IBC packet callbacks Application developers that wish to consume IBC packet callbacks and react upon packet acknowledgements must continue using the controller submodule's legacy APIs. The authentication modules will not need a ScopedKeeper anymore, though, because the channel capability will be claimed by the controller submodule. For example, given an Interchain Accounts authentication module keeper ICAAuthKeeper, the authentication module's ScopedKeeper (scopedICAAuthKeeper) is not needed anymore and can be removed for the argument list of the keeper constructor function, as shown here: app.ICAAuthKeeper = icaauthkeeper.NewKeeper( appCodec, keys[icaauthtypes.StoreKey], app.ICAControllerKeeper, - scopedICAAuthKeeper, ) Please note that the authentication module's ScopedKeeper name is still needed as part of the channel capability migration described in section Upgrade proposal above. Therefore the authentication module's ScopedKeeper cannot be completely removed from the chain code until the migration has run. In the future, the use of the legacy APIs for accessing packet callbacks will be replaced by IBC Actor Callbacks (see ADR 008 for more details) and it will also be possible to access them with the MsgServiceRouter. My authentication module does not need access to IBC packet callbacks The authentication module can migrate from using the legacy APIs and it can be composed instead with the MsgServiceRouter, so that the authentication module is able to pass messages to the controller submodule's MsgServer to register interchain accounts and send packets to the interchain account. For example, given an Interchain Accounts authentication module keeper ICAAuthKeeper, the ICS27 controller submodule keeper (ICAControllerKeeper) and authentication module scoped keeper (scopedICAAuthKeeper) are not needed anymore and can be replaced with the MsgServiceRouter, as shown here: app.ICAAuthKeeper = icaauthkeeper.NewKeeper( appCodec, keys[icaauthtypes.StoreKey], - app.ICAControllerKeeper, - scopedICAAuthKeeper, + app.MsgServiceRouter(), ) In your authentication module you can route messages to the controller submodule's MsgServer instead of using the legacy APIs. For example, for registering an interchain account: - if err := keeper.icaControllerKeeper.RegisterInterchainAccount( - ctx, - connectionID, - owner.String(), - version, - ); err != nil { - return err - } + msg := controllertypes.NewMsgRegisterInterchainAccount( + connectionID, + owner.String(), + version, + ) + handler := keeper.msgRouter.Handler(msg) + res, err := handler(ctx, msg) + if err != nil { + return err + } where controllertypes is an import alias for \"github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/v6/modules/apps/27-interchain-accounts/controller/types\". In addition, in this use case the authentication module does not need to implement the IBCModule interface anymore. I do not need a custom authentication module anymore If your authentication module does not have any extra functionality compared to the default authentication module added in ibc-go v6 (the MsgServer), or if you can use a generic authentication module, such as the x/auth, x/gov or x/group modules from the Cosmos SDK (v0.46 and later), then you can remove your authentication module completely and use instead the gRPC endpoints of the MsgServer or the CLI added in ibc-go v6. Please remember that the authentication module's ScopedKeeper name is still needed as part of the channel capability migration described in section Upgrade proposal above. Host params​ The ICS27 host submodule default params have been updated to include the AllowAllHostMsgs wildcard *. This enables execution of any sdk.Msg type for ICS27 registered on the host chain InterfaceRegistry. // AllowAllHostMsgs holds the string key that allows all message types on interchain accounts host module const AllowAllHostMsgs = \"*\" ... // DefaultParams is the default parameter configuration for the host submodule func DefaultParams() Params { - return NewParams(DefaultHostEnabled, nil) + return NewParams(DefaultHostEnabled, []string{AllowAllHostMsgs}) } API breaking changes​ SerializeCosmosTx takes in a []proto.Message instead of []sdk.Message. This allows for the serialization of proto messages without requiring the fulfillment of the sdk.Msg interface. The 27-interchain-accounts genesis types have been moved to their own package: modules/apps/27-interchain-acccounts/genesis/types. This change facilitates the addition of the ICS27 controller submodule MsgServer and avoids cyclic imports. This should have minimal disruption to chain developers integrating 27-interchain-accounts. The ICS27 host submodule NewKeeper function in modules/apps/27-interchain-acccounts/host/keeper now includes an additional parameter of type ICS4Wrapper.

A highly valued client might have hundreds of channels being actively used. Some of those channels might have a significant amount of locked tokens used for ICS 20. If the one third of the validator set of the chain the client represents decides to collude, they can sign off on two valid but conflicting headers each signed by the other one third of the honest validator set. The light client can now be updated with two valid, but conflicting headers at the same height. The light client cannot know which header is trustworthy and therefore evidence of such misbehaviour is likely to be submitted resulting in a frozen light client. Frozen light clients cannot be updated under any circumstance except via a governance proposal. Since a quorum of validators can sign arbitrary state roots which may not be valid executions of the state machine, a governance proposal has been added to ease the complexity of unfreezing or updating clients which have become \"stuck\". Without this mechanism, validator sets would need to construct a state root to unfreeze the client. Unfreezing clients, re-enables all of the channels built upon that client. This may result in recovery of otherwise lost funds. Tendermint light clients may become expired if the trusting period has passed since their last update. This may occur if relayers stop submitting headers to update the clients. An unplanned upgrade by the counterparty chain may also result in expired clients. If the counterparty chain undergoes an unplanned upgrade, there may be no commitment to that upgrade signed by the validator set before the chain ID changes. In this situation, the validator set of the last valid update for the light client is never expected to produce another valid header since the chain ID has changed, which will ultimately lead the on-chain light client to become expired. In the case that a highly valued light client is frozen, expired, or rendered non-updateable, a governance proposal may be submitted to update this client, known as the subject client. The proposal includes the client identifier for the subject and the client identifier for a substitute client. Light client implementations may implement custom updating logic, but in most cases, the subject will be updated to the latest consensus state of the substitute client, if the proposal passes. The substitute client is used as a \"stand in\" while the subject is on trial. It is best practice to create a substitute client after the subject has become frozen to avoid the substitute from also becoming frozen. An active substitute client allows headers to be submitted during the voting period to prevent accidental expiry once the proposal passes. note two of these parameters: AllowUpdateAfterExpiry and AllowUpdateAfterMisbehavior have been deprecated, and will both be set to false upon upgrades even if they were previously set to true. These parameters will no longer play a role in restricting a client upgrade.
